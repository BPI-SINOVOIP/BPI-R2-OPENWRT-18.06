Subject: [PATCH] ath10k: suppress "Unknown eventid: 36925" warnings

FW has Smart Logging feature enabled by default for detecting failures
and processing FATAL_CONDITION_EVENTID (36925 - 0x903D) back to host.

Since ath10k doesn't implement the Smart Logging and FATAL CONDITION
EVENT processing yet, suppressing the unknown event ID warning by moving
this under ATH10K_DBG_WMI.

Simulated the same issue by having associated STA powered off when
ping flood was running from AP backbone. This triggerd STA KICKOUT
in AP followed by FATAL CONDITION event 36925.

Issue was reproduced and verified in below DUT
------------------------------------------------
AP mode of OpenWRT QCA9984 running 6.0.8 with FW ver 10.4-3.5.3-00053
